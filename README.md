## DESCRIPTION

This template is meant to serve as a foundation for every P2/P3 following the React-Express-MySQL stack, as learned in Wild Code School.
It's pre-configured with a set of tools which'll help students produce industry-quality and easier-to-maintain code, while staying as simple as possible to use.

## Setup & Use

### Project Initialization

- In VSCode, install plugins **Prettier - Code formatter** and **ESLint** and configure them
- Clone this repo, enter it
- Run command `npm run setup`
- _NB: To launch the backend server, you'll need an environment file with database credentials. You'll find a template one in `backend/.env.sample`_

### Available Commands

- `setup` : Initialization of frontend and backend, as well as all toolings

  ```sh
  npm run setup
  ```
- `migrate` : Run the database migration script

  ```sh
  npm run migrate
  ```
- `dev` : Starts both servers (frontend + backend) in one terminal

  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```
  
- `dev-front` : Starts the React frontend server

  ```sh
  npm run dev-front
  ```
  
- `dev-back` : Starts the Express backend server

  ```sh
  npm run dev-back
  ```

- `fix` : Fixes linter errors (run it if `lint` growls on your code !)

  ```sh
  npm run fix
  ```

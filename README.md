## DESCRIPTION

Welcome to our 3rd Wild Code School project.

In partnership with [@makesense](https://makesense.org/) we have developed a solution for internal decision making and ideation.

The main goal of this solution is to allow each employee to propose ideas and to make them known.

The follow-up of these ideas is done through comments written by other employees, then an edition of three votes on which the people impacted can make their choice to promote the final decision of the said idea.


## Setup & Use

### Project Initialization

- In VSCode, install plugins **Prettier - Code formatter** and **ESLint** and configure them
- Clone this repo, enter it
- Run command `npm run setup`
- _NB: To launch the backend server, you'll need an environment file with database credentials. You'll find a template one in `backend/.env.sample`_

### Available Commands

- `setup` : Initialization of frontend and backend, as well as all toolings

  ```sh
  npm run setup
  ```
- `migrate` : Run the database migration script

  ```sh
  npm run migrate
  ```
- `dev` : Starts both servers (frontend + backend) in one terminal

  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```
  
- `dev-front` : Starts the React frontend server

  ```sh
  npm run dev-front
  ```
  
- `dev-back` : Starts the Express backend server

  ```sh
  npm run dev-back
  ```

- `fix` : Fixes linter errors (run it if `lint` growls on your code !)

  ```sh
  npm run fix
  ```
